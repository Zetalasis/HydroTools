# HydroTools

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As of right now, Hydro Tools only supports the Xbox 360 version of the game.

> [!NOTE]
> As texture exporting is not yet implemented, you should use [HydroTexture Hurricane](https://github.com/pakahenepy/HydroTexture_Hurricane/).

# Usage
Run the `main.py` file with Python 3.

# Requirements
Should only need [NumPy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/) for now.

# TODOs
- [ ] Support for extracting the .APF archive file (I already have the code for this, I just need to remove the requirement for quickbms)
- [ ] Support for some models that are formatted differently (like the RubberDucky or Env_Hydroelectric_z07)
- [x] Main support for exporting dynamic/animated models
- [x] Main support for exporting static models
- [ ] Support for extracting color texture files
- [ ] Support for extracting normal texture files
